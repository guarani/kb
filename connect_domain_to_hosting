Gandi Domain Registrar

I have my domain name schrottky.com registered on gandi.com. I have hosting on rackspace.com
To connect the domain to my host, I looked on the rackspace site for their two nameservers, went to the gandi account page
and in the name server part added the two nameservers an wahlah!
